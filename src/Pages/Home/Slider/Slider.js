                As one of the oldest human inventions, pottery has been around
                since before the Neolithic period, with objects dating as far
                back to 29,000 BC.

                While in the past, the pottery industry has served marginal
                niches, todayâ€™s pottery companies are thriving thanks in part to
                a resurgence in consumer demand for unique, handmade goods over
                mass-produced items.

                Pottery has been around since the ancient people roamed the
                earth. As one of the oldest human inventions, the practice of
                pottery has developed alongside civilization. One of the most
                popular pieces dated from this time period is The Venus of Dolni
                Vestonice, discovered in the Czech Republic, a ceramic Venus
                figurine of a nude female.
